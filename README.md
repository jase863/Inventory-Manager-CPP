# Overview

This software is a basic inventory management system. It allows user to add items to their inventory, modify existing items, add more quantity to items, and delete items as desired. It has a basic command line UI with a number-based menu.

I wrote this software to prove my skills in using C++.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
